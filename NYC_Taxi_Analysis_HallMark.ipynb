In The case of zero total_amount data when trip_distance is zero, the data stands valid, where even though there are different pickup and dropoff locations, but if no trip had taken place, then its perfectly normal for total_amount to be zero. One of the possible reasons maybe that the passenger may have cancelled the trip, due to which there is no trip_distance and hence no total_amount data.\n","2. The case of zero total_amount data when trip_distance is not zero was also considered. This behaviour was observed in case of three payment types - 1 = Credit card, 2= Cash, 3 = No charge as per metadata dictionary provided for Yellow Taxis of NYC.\n","3. As per the case of payment_type 3, its valid to have the trip_distance, as here the possibility is that the driver may have used the ride for personal purposes.\n","4. But the case for payment_type 1 and 2 seems invalid. Here the trip distance is specified but there is no payment information regarding any charges.\n","5.

It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in the model.The R-squared value ranges between 0 and 1, with 0 indicating that the model does not explain any of the variance in the dependent variable, and 1 indicating a perfect fit where all the variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model.\n","  3. In some cases, R-squared can also be negative, which indicates that the model is worse than a simple horizontal line (i.e., a model that predicts the mean of the dependent variable). However, negative R-squared values are generally not meaningful and are typically not used in practice.\n","\n","1. Mean Squared Error (MSE):\n","  1.

Residual plot: A residual plot is a scatter plot of the difference between the actual values and the predicted values (i.e., the residuals) on the y-axis, and the predicted values on the x-axis. A good residual plot should show a random scattering of points around the horizontal line at y=0. If there is a clear pattern in the residuals, such as a curved line or a U-shape, then this suggests that the model is not capturing some important information in the data. The residuals should be normally distributed around zero. If the residuals are skewed, or if there are outliers in the data, then this suggests that the model is not capturing some important information in the data.\n","\n","2.

A good Q-Q plot should show a straight line. If the residuals follow a straight line on the Q-Q plot, then this suggests that they are normally distributed.
